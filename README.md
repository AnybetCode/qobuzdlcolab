QobuzDL for Google Colab

## Use
This is a Google Colab I created, the original tool I'm using is QobuzDL by vitiko98 (https://github.com/vitiko98/qobuz-dl) and is a powerful Hi-Res music downloader from Qobuz service.

1. First, go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RkEKySCRLRvKrOwPmlzii-PSBYVX3gnF?usp=sharing
2. Click the Connect button
3. If promped, sign-in to your Google Account
4. Now execute all command cells one by one until you reach the final one
5. In the final one replace ```Qobuz_URL_of_your_song``` with the URL of your song

## Downloading FLAC file
After ```qobuz-dl``` completes the download of your song, go to the sidebar > Files and open the directory called Qobuz Downloads and then open the directory of your song until you find the .flac file, when you find it, click on the 3-dot button that's next the file's name and click Download

## Why this tool?
I faced too much problems when installing Python 3.10 on my PC because it is a fresh install of Windows 8.1 (yeah, it's a crappy old PC) and I know there are much people facing same problem as mine, so I created this
